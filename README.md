# M600 Flight Dataset Tools

These are useful tools to visualize data in the M600 flight dataset. The M600 Flight Dataset contains over 30 km of grayscale images collected at 3 different locations across Canada. Specifically, these locations include paths in Suffield, Montreal and the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) in Toronto. In these experiments, a DJI M600 UAV with gimballed camera is flown to create a Teach run which is immediately followed by a Repeat run traversed in the reverse direction. For each path, we also include Google Earth images. Data is provided in human-readable text files. Teach and Repeat runs can be download individually as needed. Our data is well-suited for research in UAV visual localization including robustness to perspective change, lighting change and seasonal changes. Other potential use cases include satellite image UAV navigation, experience-based localization and simulatenous localization and mapping.

When running the scripts, you need to set the data folder and results folder: for example,

data_folder = "/Users/melissagreeff/Documents/montreal_trial1/teach/"

results_folder =  "/Users/melissagreeff/Documents/montreal_trial1/teach/"
