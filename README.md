# m600_dataset_tools

These are useful tools to visualize data in the M600 flight dataset, see ## for more details. 

When running the scripts, you need to set the data folder and results folder: for example, //
data_folder = "/Users/melissagreeff/Documents/montreal_trial1/teach/"
results_folder =  "/Users/melissagreeff/Documents/montreal_trial1/teach/"
